# Data Structures and Algorithms
A repo for the implementation of basic Algorithms, Data structures and their implementation.

## Problems
1. Write a program to convert prefix expression to postfix.
2. Write a program to convert infix expressions to postfix.
3. Write a program to evaluate postfix expressions.
4. Write a program to simulate a queue of customers in a bank. Customers must be served one at a time and the customer that has been waiting the longest must be served first.
5. Implement a stack using a circularly linked list with the following operations:
    * push - Inserts an element into the stack.
    * pop - Dispalys and delets an element at the top of the stack.
    * top - Displays the elemet at the top of the stack.
    * isEmpty - Returns true if the stack is empty and false otherwise.
    * isFull - Returns true if the stack is full and false otherwise.
6. Implement a queue using a circularly linked list with the following operations:
    * enqueue - Inserts an element at the end of the queue.
    * dequeue - Displays and deletes an element from the front of the queue.
    * rear - Dispalys the last element of the queue.
    * front - Displays the first element of the queue.
    * isEmpty - Returns true if the queue is empty and false otherwise.
    * isFull - Returns true if the queue is full and false otherwise.
7. Implement the following tree traversal techniques:
    * Inorder traversal
    * Preorder traversal
    * Postorder traversal
8. Implement a binary search tree (BST). Your implementation must support the following operations:
    * searchBST(root, targetKey): Search a BST for the requested key
    * addBST(root, newNode): Add a node to the BST
    * deleteBST(rot, keyToDelete): Delete a node from the BST
9. Implement heap data structure and use it to implement an ascending priority queue.
10. Implement graph data structure. Use your implementation to create some graphs, and then perform depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) on them.
11. Implement Kruskal's algorith for finding a minimum spanning tree and apply it on a graph.
12. Implement Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree and apply it on a graph.
13. Implement graph data structure and use it to create a newtork of friends. Use graph traversal methods to find friends in this network.
14. Implement linear search and binary search.
15. Implement the following sorting algorithms:
    * Bubble Sort
    * Heap Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Quick Sort
